Description
-----------

The OpenBadges feature allows to integrate Mozilla "Open Badges" to issue, assign,
manage and display digital badges in Moodle LMS. Functionality for OpenBadges will
be implemented in the following components:

-- Badge creation and verification service in Moodle;

-- Moodle Block to display internal badges;

-- Support for direct pushing of internal badges to external backpack (without having
to manually download/upload them);

-- Badge displayer in Moodle (displays external badges and any internal ones that
have been pushed to backpack and shared).

For more information about the project see <http://docs.moodle.org/dev/openbadges>

The final specifications are available at <https://github.com/totara/openbadges-docs>

Current functionality description and user documentation can be found on <http://docs.moodle.org/dev/OpenBadges_User_Documentation>
