This files describes API changes in /blocks/* - activity modules,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.1 ===

* The collapsed class was removed from the navigation block to make it compatible with aria.
* New aria attributes were added on the navigation block [aria-expanded="false"].
* The tree JS handling were moved from YUI to AMD module (Jquery).

=== 2.9 ===

* The obsolete method preferred_width() was removed (it was not doing anything)
* Deprecated block_base::config_save as is not called anywhere and should not be used.
* Added instance_copy() function to the block_base class. This function allows for block
  specific data to be copied when a block is copied.

=== 2.8 ===

* The instance_config_print() function was removed. It was deprecated in
  Moodle 2.0, but without debugging notices. Since it was no longer a part
  of the code path, debugging notices would not have been displayed.
* Deprecated functions were removed from the block_base class:
** _print_block()
** _print_shadow()
** _title_html()
** _add_edit_controls()
** config_print()

=== 2.6 ===

* Deprecated /admin/block.php was removed, make sure blocks are using settings.php instead.

=== 2.4 ===

Created new capability 'blocks/xxx:myaddinstance' that determines whether a user can add
a specific block to their My Home page. This capability was only defined for blocks where
the applicable_formats function does not include "'my' => false" in the returned array,
allowing it be added to the My Home page.

=== 2.3 ===

required changes in code:
* block_xxx_pluginfile() is now given the 7th parameter (hopefully the last one) that
  contains additional options for the file serving. The array should be re-passed
  to send_stored_file().
