Feature: Gradebook calculations for calculated grade items before the fix 20150627
  In order to make sure the grades are not changed after upgrade
  As a teacher
  I need to be able to freeze gradebook calculations

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And gradebook calculations for the course "C1" are frozen at version "20150627"
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                | idnumber |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com | t1       |
      | student1 | Student   | 1        | student1@example.com | s1       |
      | student2 | Student   | 2        | student2@example.com | s2       |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
      | student2 | C1     | student        |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I navigate to "Grades" node in "Course administration"
    And I navigate to "Gradebook setup" node in "Grade administration > Setup"
