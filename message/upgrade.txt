This files describes API changes in /message/ messaging system,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.9 ===
* Renderer method \core_message_renderer::manage_messagingoptions now accepts a user id parameter as well.

=== 2.6 ===
* Message processor extending message_output, should return true in can_send_to_any_users()
  if it supports message sending to internal (noreply/support) users.
* Message API has been changed to allow attachments. Message processors that can support
  attachments can now use additional parameter as a part of $eventdata. To send attachments,
  $eventdata should contain properties called "attachment" (must be stored_file) and
  "attachname" (string). Currently, email message processor is the only one to support
  attachments.

=== 2.2 ===

required changes:
* lib/messagelib.php message_send($eventdata)
  $eventdata->userto should contain a property called "emailstop", $eventdata->userto->emailstop
  If it is absent it will be retrieved from the user table causing an additional database query
