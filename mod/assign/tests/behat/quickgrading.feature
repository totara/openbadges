Feature: In an assignment, teachers grade multiple students on one page
  In order to quickly give students grades and feedback
  As a teacher
  I need to grade multiple students on one page

  Scenario: Saving but not grading a grade should
    not indicate the grade is graded.
    Given the following "courses" exist:

    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "Assignment" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Assignment name | Test assignment name |
      | Description | Submit your online text |
      | assignsubmission_onlinetext_enabled | 1 |
    And I log out
