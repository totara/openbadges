  As a teacher
  I need to set a minimum number of discussions to mark the forum activity as completed

  @javascript
  Scenario: Set X number of discussions as a condition
    Given the following "users" exist:

      | Completion tracking | Show activity as complete when conditions are met |
      | completiondiscussionsenabled | 1 |

    Then I hover "//li[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' modtype_forum ')]/descendant::img[@alt='Not completed: Test forum name']" "xpath_element"
    And I add a new discussion to "Test forum name" forum with:
      | Subject | Post 1 subject |
      | Message | Body 1 content |
    And I add a new discussion to "Test forum name" forum with:
