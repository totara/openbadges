  In order to post to groups in a forum with separate groups and groupings
  As a teacher
  I need to have groups configured to post to a group

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email            |
      | teacher1 | teacher1  | teacher1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | teacher |
    And the following "groups" exist:
      | name | course | idnumber |
      | G1G1 | C1 | G1G1 |
      | G1G2 | C1 | G1G2 |

    And the following "groupings" exist:
      | name | course | idnumber |
      | G1   | C1     | G1       |
      | G2   | C1     | G2       |

      | G1       | G1G2    |
      | G2       | G2G1    |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "Forum" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Forum name  | Multiple groups forum             |
      | Forum type  | Standard forum for general use    |
      | Description | Standard forum description        |
      | Group mode  | Separate groups                   |
      | Grouping    | G1                                |

      | Description | Standard forum description        |

      | Grouping    | G2                                |
    And I log out

  Scenario: Teacher with accessallgroups can post in all groups
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I follow "Multiple groups forum"
    When I click on "Add a new discussion topic" "button"
    Then the "Group" select box should contain "All participants"
    And the "Group" select box should contain "G1G1"
    And the "Group" select box should contain "G1G2"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I follow "Single groups forum"
    And I click on "Add a new discussion topic" "button"
    And the "Group" select box should contain "All participants"
    And the "Group" select box should contain "G2G1"
    And I should see "Post a copy to all groups"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher in all groups but without accessallgroups can post in either group but not to All Participants
    And I log in as "admin"

    Given I log in as "teacher1"
