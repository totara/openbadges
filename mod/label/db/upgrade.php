// alterations to database structures and other

// The upgrade function in this file will attempt

// If there's something it cannot do itself, it
// will tell you what you need to do.
//
// The commands in here will all be database-neutral,
// using the methods of database_manager class
//
// Please do not forget to use upgrade_set_timeout()
// before any action that may take longer time to finish.
