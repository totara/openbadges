  As a teacher

    And I set the field "Advanced grade item options" to "hiddenuntil"
    And I press "Save changes"

      | Completion tracking | Show activity as complete when conditions are met |
      | Attempts allowed | 4 |
      | Require passing grade | 1 |
    And I add a "True/False" question to the "Test quiz name" quiz with:
      | Question name                      | First question                          |
      | Question text                      | Answer the first question               |
