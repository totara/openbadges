This files describes API changes in the mod_scorm code.

=== 3.0 ===

* External function mod_scorm_external::get_scorms_by_courses returned parameter "name" has been changed to PARAM_RAW,
  this is because the new external_format_string function may return raw data if the global moodlewssettingraw parameter is used.
* Function scorm_view_display was renamed to scorm_print_launch to avoid
  confussion with new function scorm_view.

=== 2.8 ===

* Coding style fixes. A large number of coding style issues were fixed in MDL-45887. This means any local modifications
 to mod_scorm are likely to conflict.

* All scorm report plugins should use namespaced classnames now. Refer MDL-46469 for details.
